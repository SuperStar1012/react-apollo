# Change log

Expect active development and potentially significant breaking changes in the `0.x` track. We'll try to be diligent about releasing a `1.0` version in a timely fashion (ideally within 1 or 2 months), so that we can take advantage of SemVer to signify breaking changes from that point on.

### v0.1.2

Adjust loading lifecycle marker to better match the behavoir of apollo-client (https://github.com/apollostack/react-apollo/pull/11)

### v0.1.1

Update to support new observable API from apollo-client (https://github.com/apollostack/react-apollo/pull/9)

### v0.1.0

Initial release. Brings in support for binding GraphQL data to components easily as well as perform mutations.

We didn't track changes before this version.
